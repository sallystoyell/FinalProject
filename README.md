## FinalProject

A final project for EPSY 5122

Codes a card memory game using tkinter (MemoryGame.py) and allows for some simple analyses of data created by users playing the game (Analyze.py)

Analyze.py calls the log files from the "Logs_ToUse" folder, so be sure that you move the logs you create to that folder if you want to include them in the analyses
